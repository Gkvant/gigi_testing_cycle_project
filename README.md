# gigi_testing_cycle_project
Web and Mobile Test Project 'JPetStore' 

A testing project carried out by my teammates and me (thanks to Fredi and David) during our software testing course.

We applied various testing techniques, executed test cases on the Website of the store we received, documented the results, and reported defects.

We also verified compatibility across different browsers and platforms.


During the process, we prepared an:
-	*STP* (Software Test Plan).

-	*STD* (Software Test Design).

-	*STR* (Test Summary Report).

-	*Bug Report*.
  
All the files are available in the attached link to Google Sheets:
